This is the code for a simple API like thing , where you will enter url of an image and will receive a JSON file of number of faces in the image.


## Some things to consider :
	Most of the folders were made by default "WEBSTORM".
	Go to dependencies.md for required libraries.
	http://localhost:8080/	- Sky
	http://localhost:3000/	- Moon




## HOW TO USE:

	1) It requires 'moon' to work.
		You can download that from "https://github.com/AYESDIE/moon-emotion-recognition"
	2) Copy its content to ..sky/moon
		Make sure moon folder has 'moon.py' file in it

	3) Open the terminal and write
		node sky.js

	4) Now run /moon/server.py
		Make sure both are running.

	5) Go to the address given by sky.js and use the app
	
	6) In the end, you will get the number of faces at http://localhost:3000/faces (This is operated by server.py) 


## STATE :
	Very Buggy
